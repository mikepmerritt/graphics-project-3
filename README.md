# graphics-project-3

This code is the full scene for Project 3: Interactive 3D Scene, done by Matthew Merritt, Michael Merritt, and Harsh Gandhi. 

## Running the Scene

Ensure that you have the following python packages installed:

```
pygame == 2.6.0
PyOpenGL == 3.1.7
```

Once the packages are installed, run the following:

```bash
python interactive_scene_pygame.py
```

An additional window should open with the interactive 3D scene.

## Files

The code is divided into three files, with the following breakdown:

- `interactive_scene_pygame.py` - Contains the interactive 3D scene with tables, lights, objects, and player controls. This is the file that should be run.
- `utils.py` - Supporting module borrowed from class examples. Includes classes for points and vectors.
- `camera.py` - Supporting module borrowed from class examples. Includes camera movement and rotation.
